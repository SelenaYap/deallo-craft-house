Welcome to our workspace. Deallo Craft House is a project created for SWE30010: Development Project 2. This project aims to create a workable e-commerce platform for handcrafters to buy and sell products with the help of online transactions and delivery. The development of this project uses PHP, MySQL, and AngularJS. Basic coding rules apply by using lower case letters for attributes and elements. To provide convenience and ease of communication, all updates must be accompanied with a message on the progress done. 

## To download this respository, please follow the guidelines shown below: 

1. Open Git Bash or Command Line and change the working directory to your XAMPP HTDOCS folder: 
   Working Directory
    
       'cd C:\xampp\htdocs'
     
2. After changing your directory, enter your username and email with Git's identity setup: 
    **Note: If you are using Git Bash, you will only have to do this once.** 
    
       'git config --global user.name Username'
       'git config --global user.email username@mail.com'
   
 3. To verify your username and email if typed correctly: 
       **Optional**
 
        'git config --global user.name'
        'git config --global user.email'

4. Clone the respository by copying the URL and placing it next to the Git Command 
              
              
              'git clone https://github.com/ivychiew/deallo-craft-house.git'
       
    
   **Make sure that it is cloned into the working directory within the XAMPP folder.**
   
   **This will be your offline respository recognised by Git.**
   
   **The folders cloned from the URL must match with those appearing in Git.**
   
   **Changes made must be tested, and documented for your tasks. Remember to screenshot your work process and results** 

7. When you'd like to update the respository: 

    _Please update your group members that you are gonna update the respository_
   
    **Make a backup of the previous folder before committing.**
    
    **to include what will be committed.**
         
         'git add <file name*>'
    
    **to check which files are not added to be committed.** 
        
         'git status' 
         
    **commit changed files**
    
         'git commit -m "Example of what has been changed"'
         
    **to check if the items in the local folder matches with what will be pushed to the respository**
    
        'git status' 
    
    **If it displays:**
      
        'nothing to commit'

       'git push'
